Spoken-Experiments
==================

This is just a simple project built around playing with the 'say' module in NPM as part of my personal experimentation with node.js. 

In, "SayWhat.js", I've implemented a basic vocalizer that will say words that you type as they come in from simple IO. The vocalizer will attempt to use the English voice, 'Daniel', which you can download in via the "Dictation & Speech" systems module on OSX. 

"SpokenNim" is a simple game of Nim spoken by the computer. It uses a basic backtracking algorithm for play. It also uses an OSX specific "ribbons" library for vocalization, different from saywhat. 

Please enjoy, and augment at will.
